The two manage to strike up some kind of relationship when Buddy's mum walks out - until Buddy realises that his dad is involved in something more serious than he suspected.
        The story is a ficion and the story deals with issues such as racism and thieving.
        Buddy is a young boy who comes from a poor home, he is neglected by his parents and is often picked on at school for being poor. He lives at home with his parents. It all starts when Buddy wants some money to go on a school trip, but he knows that he is unlikely to go as he was unable to go on previous school trips because his parents do not have the money. When his mother tells him she does not have any money to give him, Buddy ends up stealing the money from her purse. His mother soon finds the money missing and asks Buddy where the money is. After admitting that he did take the money, his mum leaves the room, and being angry at Buddy, she replies, "Like father, like son," as his father was previously sent to prison for breaking and entering. Before leaving she adds "thief," and leaves Buddy upset crying. The next day Buddy finds out his mum has left him alone. Four months later, with his mum still missing, Buddy is still being bullied at school, often being called dustman by the pupils and even his teacher, due to the state of his clothes. On top of this, Buddy is also bullied because he is friends with black twins Julius and Charmian who are also picked on in school.
